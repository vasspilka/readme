# How Vas Works

## What is this?
This document has been inspired by my former CTO Shawn Vo. 
Instructions and documentation can be so valueable in products so why not have one for yourself.
Here are some information on how I work, how can I be helpfull, and what are some of my quircks.

## Communication
Open and on point communication is prefered, and it is appreciated when people are honest in criticism or otherwise.
I tend to openly say my opinion or what is in my mind at the time, I can have wrong assumtions and my opinions 
change over time, feel free to challenge them or ask about my confidence in a certain idea.

As a rule I try to be on top of any asynchronous commnications, if there is something I can help with or should know, let me know.
Responses are usually fast as I can get easily disctracted, for this exact reason it's good for me to sometimes silence notifications to be more focused.

In general I can express myself and my ideas well, however at times I can struggle with words, if I show difficulty formulating my idea to words
I usually need some time to formulate my thoughts or find the words. I best communicate when there is a lot of shared context.

## What I do
I love to find solutions, in fact I've always had a mind that could not stay away from problems ;p ,
I like to think about them and it fulfils me when I can solve them. As a software developer I do
that by discussing, analyzing, writing code/documents and holding context. I usually work on product realted problems, however
I am always happy when I can help in other areas aswell.


## Availability
I will have a schedule with the hours I tend to be available, however one should always feel comfortable to send me a message if needed.
Even though I do have a work schedule at times I will not be following it, this can happen when I have many things to do or when I prefer to do
something at a different time in the day.

## Meetings
I am most effective in a meeting when I know what is the intend and goals beforehand. I think meetings provide more value when there is an agenda.
In longer meetings in which I am not actively involved I will find it hard to be engaged feel tired afterwards.

## Pairing
I think pairing is an effective way of writing quality code and keeping good relations, if possible I will encourage people to
pair up on tasks when it's reasonable.

## Important To Know

* I can sometimes make premature assumptions and jump to conclusions that are incorect. Don't always trust the first thing I say when we dealing with something novel, context about the subject will help me realise what re are dealing with.
* I have difficulties with distractions, it's can hard for me not to pay attention when something is else is happening, for that reasons I prefer to work without many distractions around or in settings I can ignore the background.
* I might come out as defensive or dismissive, that's very rarely the case, most likely I typed while having something else in my mind or wanted to respond fast.
* I sometimes have high expectations for myself and work, at times I might point them out. I am fully aware that for the vast majority of occasions things can be good enough, I acknowledge that not all of my expecations will not get fulfilled.
