# How to work with Vas

## What is this?
This document has been inspired by my former CTO Shawn Vo. 
Instructions and documentation can be so valueable in products so why not have one for yourself.
Here are some information on how I work, how can I be helpfull, and what are some of my quircks.

## Communication
I prefer open and on point communication, I appreciate it when people are honest in criticism or otherwise.
I tend to openly say my opinion or what I think at the time, I can have wrong assumtions and my opinions 
change over time, feel free to challenge them or ask about my confidence in a certain idea.

As a rule I try to be on top of any asynchronous commnications, if there is something I can help with or should know, let me know.
I usually respond fast as I can get easily disctracted, for this exact reason I sometimes silence notifications when I need to be more focused.

In general I can express myself and my ideas well, however at times I can struggle with words, if I show difficulty formulating my idea to words
I usually need some time to formulate my thoughts or find the words. I best communicate when there is a lot of shared context.

## What I do
I love to find solutions, in fact I've always had a mind that could not stay away from problems ;p ,
I like to think about them and it fulfils me when I can solve them. As a software developer I do
that by discussing, analyzing, writing code/documents and holding context. I usually I will work on product realted problems, however
I am always happy when I can help in other areas aswell.


## Availability
I will have a schedule with the hours I tend to be available, however one should always feel comfortable to send me a message if needed.
Even though I do have a work schedule at times I will not be following it, this can happen when I have many things to do or when I prefer to do
something at a different time in the day.

## Important To Know

* I can sometimes make premature assumptions and jump to conclusions that are incorect. Don't always trust the first thing I say when we dealing with something novel, context about the subject will help me realise what re are dealing with.
* I have difficulties with distractions, it's can hard for me not to pay attention when something is else is happening, for that reasons I prefer to work without many distractions around or in settings I can ignore the background.
