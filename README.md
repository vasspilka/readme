# How Vas Works

## What is this?
This document has been inspired by my former CTO Shawn Vo. 
Instructions and documentation can be so valueable in products so why not have one for yourself.
Here are some information on how I work, how can I be helpfull, and what are some of my quircks.
I'll be addressing myself in third person as I feel it makes this text more readable.

## Communication
Open and direct communication is prefered, and it is very appreciated when people are honest in criticism or otherwise.
He tend to openly say his opinion or what is in his mind at the time, He can have wrong assumtions and his opinions 
change over time, feel free to challenge them or ask about his confidence in a certain idea.

He always tries to be on top of any asynchronous commnications, if there is something he can help with or should know, let him know.
Responses are usually fast as he can get easily disctracted, for this exact reason it's good for him to sometimes silence notifications to be more focused.

In general he can express himself and his ideas well, however when stressed he can struggle with words, if he is showing difficulty experssing his ideas he usually just needs some time to formulate his thoughts better and find the appropriate words. He best communicates when there is a lot of shared context.

## What Vasilis does
He loves finding solutions, in fact he's always had a mind that could not stay away from problems ;p ,
He likse to think about them and it fulfils him when he can solve them. As a software developer he does
that by discussing, analyzing, writing code/documents and holding context. He usually works on product realted problems, however
he is always happy when he can help in other areas aswell.


## Availability
There will be a work schedule with preferred hours of work, however one should always feel comfortable to contact him when needed.
His work schedule is not strickt, there are times we need to deal with something no matter the time, and in other cases
he might decide to do something earlier or later in the day.

## Meetings
He will be most effective in a meeting when the intend and goals are known beforehand, preferably meetings have an agenda or document associated with them.
In longer meetings in which he is not actively involved he can find it hard to be engaged and feels tired afterwards.

## Pairing
Pairing is an effective way of writing quality code and keeping good relations, if possible he will encourage people to
pair up on tasks when it's reasonable.

## Important To Know

* He can sometimes make premature assumptions and jump to conclusions that are incorect. Don't always trust the first thing he sais when we dealing with something novel or he has only partial information, this will usually happen when there is missing context and he has to fill the gaps.
* He has difficulties with distractions, it's can hard for him not to pay attention when something else is happening, for that reasons he prefers to work without many distractions around or in settings he can ignore the background.
* He might come out as defensive or dismissive, that's almost never the case, most likely he typed while having something else in his mind or wanted to respond fast.
* He has high expectations for himself and our work, at times he might point the "ideal" thing. He is fully aware that for the vast majority of occasions good enough is sufficient, he acknowledges that and accepts that not all of his expecations will get fulfilled.
